# Gusu Made Platform

Gusu Made is a custom cultural and creative product platform that mixes AI image generation with handcraft aesthetics. The code base was migrated to **Vue&nbsp;3** using **Vite** for a simpler development experience while the original UniApp resources remain for reference.

## Development

### Install dependencies
```bash
cd vite-app
npm install
```

### Run a development server
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts the app at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```
The compiled files will appear in `vite-app/dist/`.
